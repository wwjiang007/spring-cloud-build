Spring Cloud Build is a common utility project for Spring Cloud
to use for plugin and dependency management.

== Building and Deploying

To install locally:

----

$ mvn install -s .settings.xml
----

and to deploy snapshots to repo.spring.io:

----
$ mvn deploy -DaltSnapshotDeploymentRepository=repo.spring.io::default::https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot-local
----

for a RELEASE build use

----
$ mvn deploy -DaltReleaseDeploymentRepository=repo.spring.io::default::https://repo.spring.io/libs-release-local
----

and for jcenter use

----
$ mvn deploy -DaltReleaseDeploymentRepository=bintray::default::https://api.bintray.com/maven/spring/jars/org.springframework.cloud:build
----

and for Maven Central use

----
$ mvn deploy -P central -DaltReleaseDeploymentRepository=sonatype-nexus-staging::default::https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2
----

(the "central" profile is available for all projects in Spring Cloud and it sets up the gpg jar signing, and the repository has to be specified separately for this project because it is a parent of the starter parent which users in turn have as their own parent).
